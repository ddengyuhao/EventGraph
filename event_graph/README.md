**EventGraph-LMM** is a novel framework for long video understanding that constructs a semantic-temporal graph to select key events efficiently.

## 🚀 Features
- **Graph-based Keyframe Selection**: Uses CELF algorithm to maximize information gain.
- **Multi-Backbone Support**: Supports Video-LLaVA, Qwen2-VL, and LLaVA-NeXT.
- **Efficient Inference**: Reduces token usage while maintaining high accuracy.
